As a busy individual who uses psychoactive substances for personal benefit, Max wants to ensure that he is using them in a safe and consistent way. He downloads Neuronek to help him keep track of his usage and optimize his dosages.

When Max opens the app, he selects the "Dosage Reminders" feature and inputs the name and type of the substance he is taking, as well as the desired dosage and time of day he wants to take it. He sets reminders for himself to take the substance at the designated time, and he is able to adjust the reminders to fit his schedule.

Neuronek provides Max with notifications and reminders to ensure that he is taking the substance at the designated time and dosage. The app also provides him with insights into his usage patterns and potential risks, sending notifications when his usage patterns indicate a potential risk for addiction or other negative health outcomes.

Over time, Max is able to track his progress towards his goals and adjust his usage accordingly. Thanks to Neuronek's Dosage Reminders feature, Max is able to use psychoactive substances in a safe and consistent way, without experiencing any negative side effects or risks to his health. He feels empowered and in control of his usage, and he recommends the app to his friends and family who are also interested in using psychoactive substances for personal benefit.
