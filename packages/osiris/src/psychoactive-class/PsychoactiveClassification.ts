Members of this class are characterized by distorted sensory perceptions and feelings of disconnection or detachment from the environment and self. The phenomenology is often described in terms of reducing or blocking signals to the conscious mind from other parts of the central nervous system. */

They display a unique property in that they easily produce solid hallucinations which integrate seamlessly into waking consciousness, similar to fully formed dreams or delusions.

The term "empathogen" was coined in 1983 by Ralph Metzner to denote chemical agents capable of inducing feelings of empathy. "Entactogen" was coined by David E. Nichols as an alternative to "empathogen," attempting to avoid the potential for an improper association of the latter with negative connotations related to the Greek root "pathos" (suffering). */

Jonathan Ott is credited with coining the term in 1979. */
